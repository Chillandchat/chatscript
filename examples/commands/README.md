## Commands

Welcome to the commands example! This example we will learn how to make a command system! This example you will learn how to run some code when a user types a certain command. Kinda like a command line!

### Logic

In the file, we are using a listener to listen for a message in the selected room then, we will compare the message to the command. If it matches, then the code in the command will fire.

Without further ado go ahead and look at `index.ts`!
